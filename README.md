# Behold my bad-idea-inator.  My anti-conceptatron.  One could call it a prepostetron.

Idea generators are the work of fiction (or rather, fantasy, because they're so stupid) but what if we made something much worse and even more useless?

The plan is to strap a patent database to a Generative Adversarial Network until I can reliably produce terrible patents.  Maybe if that somehow works I'll also use the preexisting patent database + how many times it is referenced in journals or how many units of derivative products were produced to rank the generated patents.  It's going to be a total shit show.

### But How, You Ask, Does One Get That Data?  And How Does The GAN Work??

Here's how it works.  The patents' <s>[REDACTED]</s> goes into a <s>[REDACTED]</s>ing AI which <s>[REDACTED]</s>

IDFK, this project is doomed to fail.  But it should fail.  so it's blessed to fail.  And blasphemous should it succeed.
