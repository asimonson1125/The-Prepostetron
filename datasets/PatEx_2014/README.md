## Patent Examination Research Dataset (PatEx) from [uspto.gov](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/patent-examination-research-dataset-public-pair)

This data is Gigantor. Some files could be interesting:
 - `correspondence_address.csv` names of agencies and companies, presumably that find the patent relevant
 - `all_inventors.csv` Not applicable to this project but we got names and states.  Could be interesting for... something? idk
