## About Datasets

To not murder github and possibly myself from data misusage, all data is git ignored.  Sources listed in each folder.

Use [this Data Dictionary](https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-dictionary) to preview table headers for [patentsview.org](https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables) data.

Fair warning if you download the data be very careful not to accidentally open it in software that might accidentally try to read the whole file at once
